This directory is the "source" directory of a Python 3 package project, but
it is made to be also distributable and usable on its own, without
installing the package.  Moreover, the package installation may skip some
contents of this directory (for example, it may skip this README).

If distributing this directory on its own, consider renaming it to
"{project name}-{source version}".
